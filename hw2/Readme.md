This file contains all the detailed tasks for hw2.
They are divided into four parts, the first 2 are tree implementations,and the last two are graph implementations.
I've also added some implementations that weren't required but were related to the assignments. Please view them and provide feedback if possible. 
I implemented some of the exercises in C and Python just to test the speed and ease of implementation.
Most of them were straight forward hence no need of many tests, so that was factored in as well.
The repo is still a bit cluttered, and will be arranged soon.
I hope the comments are helpful enough in understanding the implementation.
